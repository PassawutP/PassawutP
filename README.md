✋✋✋  Hello, people of the internet! ✋✋✋
My name is Passawut Prinyagul, a fellow beginner programmer and a internet surfer 🏄.
📚🕯😫 Right now, I am studying 1st year in the bachlor degree of information and communication engineering, something between software engineering and hardware engineering. 
🧑‍💻 For programming, I’m interested in writing code such as Python, C++, Javascipt, HTML, CSS and PHP.
I am in that stage of wanting to create my own website and trying out other things that might interest me such as cybersecurity, ai and competitive programming.
As I said, I am currently developing my first website and it would be really appreciated for you to see my first idea that I came up with.
I don't know when will the website be released, but I will keep you updated as much as possible.
For the detail of the website, it will be something like website advertisement for small creators, and I will certainly have privilege for people who support and follow me. 
📫 To reach out to me, in official way, you can email to me at passawut.prinyagul@gmail.com. 
😎 In unofficial way, you can either direct message me in instagram at @ice_passawut and in facebook at Passawut Prinyagul.
For disclaimer, I may not respond right away because I would consider myself as a very busy guy, and if there is any mistake that I made, I would like to apologise in advance.
